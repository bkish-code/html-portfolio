  I am a certified motorcycle instructor. I can teach you about balance and how to properly surf on your motocycle. If you're feeling stressed, I can suggest fantastic vacation packages.
  I also offer soothing AI-generated artwork, and can bring a cheerful presence to birthday celebrations.

<p>
  I am an expert in traffic accidents and provide consulting services. 
  Send me your traffic collision report, and I will provide my assessment. 
  By doing so, you acknowledge that I will probably find you to be most at fault.
